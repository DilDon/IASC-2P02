"Both Moretti and Drucker argue that visual forms (e.g. graphs, maps, etc.) can and should be used to represent cultural phenomena (e.g. the experience of temporality, rises and falls in genre, etc.). Moving between written and visual mediums of expression offers a model for the next generation of digital humanities scholarship, where readers are asked to think critically across both textual and graphical modes. As such, digital humanities scholarship should increasingly create multimodal scholarship where readers interpret both the text and any other media (such as graphs, images, audio, and so on). Creating scholarship that asks readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish digital humanities scholarship from scholarship in the sciences."

Personally, I agree with this. I believe that by creating multimodal scholarships, readers would learn to look beyond the surface. With how open the Digital Humanities are, it makes sense that they should be creating more multlimodal scholarships. By incorporating a multimodal form of learning, you would be able to benefit students with different learning styles since multimodal learning engages the brain in multiple ways at once using various forms of media. By combining the various ways students learn, teachers would be able to create an ideal learning environment for each one of their students at once.  

As Michael Manderino puts it in the book "Legibility in the Age of Signs and Machines", the close readings of digital and visual texts today requires that we engage our students in specific non-linear strategies across multiple texts, simutaneously. "We want students to recieve training in multimodal texts, which means they have to learn how to synthesize across multiple text types." The book also suggests that we should further develop distant reading as well as close reading techniques.
